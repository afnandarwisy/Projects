## EIA190086 / 17124877


### INTRODUCTION

Burgers are one of the most popular fast-food particulars around the world, and Universiti
Malaya scholars are no exception. The preference of scholars in Universiti Malaya for
burgers is an intriguing content to explore, as it can give insight into the productive habits
and life practices of university students in Malaysia. This study aims to explore the burger
preferences of students at Universiti Malaya, with the objective of gaining a deeper
understanding of their taste preferences and factors influencing their choices.

The student population at Universiti Malaya represents a diverse group, encompassing
various ages, genders, ethnicities, faculties, and years of study. By investigating their
burger preferences, we can gain insights into the preferences and demands of this specific
demographic, which can have implications for food service providers both on-campus and
in the surrounding area.

The study will examine several key aspects of burger preferences among Universiti Malaya
students. These aspects include the frequency of burger consumption, the choice of patty
(e.g., beef, chicken, fish, vegetarian), preferred sauces and vegetables, price considerations,
and factors influencing their decisions when selecting burgers from fast-food chains. By
exploring these dimensions, we aim to identify the key factors that drive their preferences
and shape their dining choices.

This paper will begin by reviewing the literature on the burger preference of university
scholars in Malaysia, and the factors that impact their choice of burgers. It will also
describe the methodology used to conduct the study, including the sample size, data
collection styles, and data analysis ways. The results of the study will be presented,
followed by a discussion of the findings and finally, the paper will conclude with
conclusions for promoting healthy eating habits among university students in Malaysia.


### LITERATURE REVIEW

Fast food consumption, including burgers, has been associated with unhealthy dietary
behaviors and lifestyle practices, particularly among adolescents and young adults around
the world. This literature review aims to describe the previous studies conducted from 2013
to 2023 on burger and fast-food chain around the world and Malaysia.

In Saudi Arabia, fast food has become an important component of the dietary pattern for
adolescents and young adults, particularly girls, and it is associated with lower intakes of
fruits, vegetables, and milk (Nora Abdullah AlFaris et al., 2015). Another study in Tehran
discovered that fast food intake is a habit for some teenagers and young adults, and it is
frequently related to socialization and entertainment (Hesamedin Askari Majabadi et al.,
2016).

Generally, fast food consumption is a global phenomenon that is increasing in low- and
middle-income countries, and it is linked to poor dietary habits, such as a higher intake of
carbonated soft-drinks and sweets and a lower intake of fruits and vegetables (Li et al.,
2020). In United States, fast food is a staple of the American diet, and it has been linked to
high calorie intake and poor diet quality (Fryar et al., 2018).

A study conducted in Malaysia found that fast-food consumption is a problem among
adolescents, as it increases the risk of diet-related chronic diseases (Cheong Siew Man et
al., 2021). Another study conducted in Universiti Brunei Darussalam found that fast food
is a quick and cheap choice for university students, especially when the time is limited and
there is a large university workload (Tok Chen Yun et al., 2018). Most of the respondents
preferred cheap food to healthy food, and this trend was observed among the
overweight/obese population (Tok Chen Yun et al., 2018).

The outcomes of these studies give useful insights for industry practitioners, policymakers,
and scholars. This review, by analysing existing material, lays the groundwork for future
research in the realm of burgers and fast-food chains, highlighting knowledge gaps and
prospective areas for exploration.


### PROBLEM STATEMENT

The Malaysian burger market has grown significantly in recent years, owing to the
increasing popularity of fast-food chains and the growing need for convenient, quick-
service dining options. However, various obstacles and issues have surfaced in the burger
business that require further investigation. This section tries to identify and discuss the
major issues confronting Malaysia's burger sector.

- What are the key problems and challenges faced by the burger market in Malaysia?
- The burger market in Malaysia is highly competitive, but what factors contribute to
    this intense competition?
- How are changing consumer preferences impacting the burger market in Malaysia?
- In the face of price sensitivity, how do burger businesses balance affordability with
    maintaining quality?


### RESEARCH DESIGN

This research study aims to examine the burger preference among students in Universiti
Malaya. The study focuses on various factors influencing their burger choices, including
patty selection, sauce preferences, vegetable choices, price considerations, and factors
when considering burgers in fast-food chains. By investigating these aspects, the research
aims to gain insights into the factors that shape students' burger preferences and provide
valuable information for the development of targeted strategies to meet their needs and
preferences. This study will utilize a quantitative research design, employing a structured
questionnaire to collect data from the participants. The questionnaire will be designed
based on the responses obtained from the Google Form survey administered to the students.
The research will focus solely on quantitative data analysis without the inclusion of
qualitative interviews.

A representative sample of students from Universiti Malaya will be recruited to participate
in the study. The sample will be diverse in terms of gender, age, ethnicity, and faculty
representation to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the burger preferences among
students. The data will be collected through the administration of the structured
questionnaire to the selected sample of students. The questionnaire will include sections
on demographic background (age, gender, ethnicity, faculty), burger consumption
frequency, choice of patty, sauce preferences, vegetable choices, price considerations, and
factors when considering burgers in fast-food chains. The participants will be asked to
provide their responses based on their preferences and experiences. Descriptive statistics,
such as frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations, will be used to analyze
the collected data. This analysis will provide insights into the distribution, central tendency,
and variation of the variables related to burger preferences. Additionally, inferential
statistics, such as chi-square tests or ANOVA, will be conducted to explore potential
differences in burger preferences based on gender, age group, ethnicity, and faculty.

The research will adhere to ethical guidelines, ensuring confidentiality and anonymity of
the participants. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, and data will be
handled and stored securely.


### DATA ANALYSIS

Descriptive statistics offer a brief overview of a dataset's attributes. When examining
characteristics such as age, gender, ethnicity, faculty, and years of study, descriptive
statistics can be used to analyze the distribution and central tendency of each variable. This
involves calculating metrics like frequency, percentage, and cumulative percentage.

For demographic background variables, descriptive statistics can be generated to better
comprehend how participants are distributed across various categories. This enables us to
recognize the most frequent categories and determine the relative proportions of each
category in the sample.

Analyzing the descriptive statistics can yield valuable insights about the respondents'
demographic composition. For instance, we can identify the most prevalent age group, the
gender distribution, the ethnic representation, the distribution among different faculties,
and the distribution among various years of study.

Crosstabulation allows us to examine the relationships between variables. For example, we
can use crosstabulation to analyze the relationship between placetogetburger and different
demographic variables such as agegroup, gender, ethnicity, and faculty. This helps us
understand the preferences for burger places among different groups and identify any
significant associations between these variables.

The chi-square test can be used to assess the significance of relationships between
categorical variables. In the analysis, we can perform chi-square tests between variables
like placetogetburger and agegroup, gender, or ethnicity. This helps determine if there is a
significant association between these variables, indicating whether certain demographic
groups have different preferences for burger places.

For factor analysis, specifically Kendall's W test, can be applied to assess the agreement or
concordance among the ranked factors related to burger preferences. The analysis of factors
like taste, price, nutrition, waiting time, distance from location, and availability of
discounts/coupons can be examined using Kendall's W test. This helps identify the


underlying dimensions or factors that play a significant role in influencing individuals'
preferences for burgers.

Crosstabs between burger preferences and demographic background.

```
i. Burgers per month
```

The crosstabulations between "Burgers per Month" and the demographic variables of age
group, gender, ethnicity, and faculty provide insights into the relationship between burger
consumption and these demographic factors.

Participants aged 21-25 years old reported consuming burgers rarely (1-3 times) for the
majority (67.9%), indicating that this age group has a lower frequency of burger
consumption while occasional consumption (4-6 times) was reported by 32.1% of
participants in this age group.

Males reported consuming burgers rarely more frequently (58.1%) than females (41.9%).
This suggests that there may be a gender difference in burger preferences, with males
showing a slightly higher tendency to consume burgers less frequently.

Malays were the largest ethnic group (58.1%) and had the highest frequency of consuming
burgers rarely, followed by the Chinese (32.3%). Indian participants reported consuming
burgers rarely the most (100.0%), though their sample size was relatively small.

The Business and Economics faculty had the highest frequency of consuming burgers
rarely (45.2%), followed by Engineering (29.0%). The faculty of Science had the highest
percentage (100.0%) of participants who consumed burgers occasionally.


ii. Patty choices


The crosstabulations that analyze the relationship between patty choice and demographic
variables such as age group, gender, ethnicity, and faculty can reveal the preferences of
participants in each category.

As for age group, participants aged 21-25 years old showed a considerable liking for both
beef and chicken patties, with around 46.4% and 42.9% respectively choosing either
option. Participants aged 18-20 years old and 26-30 years old also showed some preference
for beef and chicken patties but to a lesser extent. The least preferred option among all age
groups was the vegetarian patty.

In terms of gender, males exhibited a stronger inclination towards beef patties (61.1%),
whereas females tended to prefer chicken patties (69.2%). The preference for vegetarian
patties was relatively low for both genders.

Regarding ethnicity, Malays indicated the highest preference for beef patties (66.7%),
while Chinese participants showed a greater fondness for chicken patties (80.0%). Indian
participants had a relatively equal distribution between beef and chicken patties, but the


overall sample size was smaller. The preference for vegetarian patties was relatively low
across all ethnicities.

Faculty-wise, engineering students displayed a distinct liking for beef patties (77.8%),
whereas business and economics students favored chicken patties (78.6%). Students
studying arts and social sciences demonstrated a diverse range of patty preferences,
including beef, chicken, and vegetarian options.

```
iii. Sauce choices
```


The crosstabulation table above comparing sauce selection and four variables - age, gender,
ethnicity, and faculty - yield valuable insights into the preferences of various groups.

In terms of gender, females tended to prefer mayonnaise (84.6%), whereas males had a
stronger inclination towards most sauces especially chilli sauce (88.9%), including
mayonnaise (66.7%) while cheese sauce and ketchup (44.4%) respectively.

Across all age groups, mayonnaise (75%) was the most popular, with chilli sauce (67.9%)
and ketchup (53.6%) being particularly favored by 21- 25 - year-olds.

Ethnicity also played a role, with Malays (88.9%) and Indians (100%) had a high
preference for chilli sauce, while Chinese (30%) showed a relatively lower preference,
while Chinese participants had a lower preference for chilli sauce, they had highest
preferences for mayonnaise (70%).

Faculty of engineering and medicine students had a 100% pronounced liking for chilli
sauce, while Business and Economics (71.4%) and FSKTM (100%) had the highest
preferences for mayonnaise, respectively.


iv. Vegetables choices



The crosstabulations between vegetable choice and the four variables (age group, gender,
ethnicity, and faculty) provide insights into the preferences of respondents in different
demographic and academic categories.

When examining age groups, lettuce was the most popular choice among respondents aged
21 - 25 years old and 26-30 years old with 75% and 100% respectively, while other
vegetables had varying levels of preference.

Regarding gender, both females (69.2%) and males (77.8%) showed a high preference for
lettuce, with onion and tomato also being popular choices.

Ethnicity-wise, lettuce was preferred by respondents across all ethnic groups among Malay,
Chinese and Indian with 72.2%, 70% and 100% respectively, while tomato coming in
second choice among them with variations in the popularity of other vegetables.

Faculty-wise, lettuce was consistently favored among Arts and Social Sciences,
Engineering, and Business and Economics respondents with 100%, 88.9% and 71.4%,
respectively while other vegetables had varying levels of preference across different
faculties.


v. Price for burgers



The crosstabulations of pay for burgers with age group, gender, ethnicity, and faculty
provide useful insights into the spending habits of respondents in different demographic
and academic categories when it comes to burgers.

In terms of age group, most respondents who were between 21-25 years old ( 50 %) were
willing to pay between RM10-20 for a burger, while a few of them willingly to pay less
than RM10 ( 42 .9%). Respondents in the 18 - 20 years old and 26 - 30 years old age group
had varied spending preferences, and no one in these age group were willing to pay less
than RM10.

When looking at gender, a higher percentage of male respondents (66.7%) preferred
spending between RM10-20 on a burger compared to female respondents (38.5%). Most
female respondents expressed a willingness to pay less than RM10 (53.8%) for a burger.

When analyzing the crosstabulation between pay for burgers and ethnicity, the distribution
of spending preferences varied among different ethnic groups. Malay respondents showed
a relatively balanced distribution across different spending ranges where they were
willingly to pay between RM10-20 (55.6%), while Chinese respondents had a higher count
in the "Less than RM10" and "RM10-20" with 50% in respective categories. Indian
respondents had a higher count in the "RM10- 20 " category (66.7%). These findings
indicate diverse spending preferences based on ethnicity.

While the crosstabulation between pay for burger and faculty, respondents from the
Business and Economics faculty had a willingness to pay "Less than RM10" (50%),
followed by "RM10-20" categories (42.9%), while respondents from the Engineering
faculty had a higher count in the "RM10-20" range (66.7%). Other faculties exhibited
varied distributions, with some showing a preference towards spending between RM 10-
20 and others distributed across different price ranges.

Overall, the results suggest that most respondents were willing to pay between RM10- 20
for a burger. However, there were variations in spending preferences based on age group,
gender, ethnicity, and faculty.


vi. Place to get burgers.


The crosstabulation analyzing the place people go to get burgers and demographic variables
such as age group, gender, ethnicity, and faculty can provide valuable insights into the
preferences of different groups regarding burger options.

Looking at age groups, the data shows that most respondents across all age groups preferred
fast-food chains. However, 35.5% of students across the age group favored hawker stalls,
while only 19.4% preferred cafes and restaurants.

Regarding gender, both males and females showed a preference for fast-food chains with
44.4% and 46.2% respectively, but a higher percentage of females (38.5%) chose hawker
stalls than males (33.3%). Cafes and restaurants were not as popular among either gender
with just 19.4%.


Examining preferences by ethnicity, Malays has equal preferences of hawker stalls and
fast-food chains with 38.9%, while 60% of Chinese respondents favored fast-food chains.
Cafes and restaurants were chosen by a small percentage of respondents across all
ethnicities.

However, by faculty, respondents from Business and Economics (50%), Medicine (50%),
and FSKTM (100%) faculties preferred fast-food chains, while those from Arts and Social
Sciences (50%), Engineering (33.3%), and Science (50%) faculties favored hawker stalls.
Cafes and restaurants were chosen by some respondents from Arts and Social Sciences
(50%) and Engineering (33.3%) faculties, while other respondents among other faculties
did not show a strong preference for any particular option and have varied preferences of
place to get their burgers.


**Analysis on ordinal data** : Factors are most important when considering a burger from a
fast-food chain? (Rank from 1 to 6, with 1 being the most important and 6 being the least
important)




The table and bar chart presents the distribution of respondents' preferences for various
factors when considering where to get a burger. The factors, labeled as factor_1 to factor_6,
are ranked in order of importance, with factor_1 being the most important and factor_6
being the least important.

Analyzing the table by factor, we can gain valuable insights into the factors that influence
respondents' decision-making process when choosing a place to get a burger.

Factor_1, representing the most important factor, stands out with the highest percentage in
most rows. For instance, in the “taste” row, factor_1 has a percentage of 45.2%. This
indicates that taste is of utmost importance to respondents when deciding where to get a
burger. The high percentage in this category emphasizes that the quality and flavor of the
burger play a significant role in their decision-making process.

Factor_2, which represents the second most important factor, “price” holds the highest
percentage in most rows with 38.7%. This suggests that factors closely related to price,
such as the price of the burger and the value for money are significant considerations for
respondents.

Factor_3, ranking as the third most important factor, “price” and “distance” from
respondents’ location have relatively higher percentages with 25.8% compared to the other
factors. This indicates that factors related to distance particularly, where people often seek
out options that are easily accessible and nearby, have moderate influence on respondents'
decision-making process when it comes to getting a burger.

Factor_4, representing the fourth most important factor, with 38.7% holds moderate
percentages across the rows which is waiting time to get a burger. This suggests that waiting
time is moderately influential in respondents' decision-making process. Waiting time
becomes particularly important for individuals who are constrained by time, mostly
students with tight schedules.

Factor_5, the fifth most important factor, shows varying percentages across the rows.
Notably, it has the highest percentage in the “nutrition” and “availability of discounts” row
with 29% and 32.3%, indicating that for some respondents, factors related to the nutritional


value of the burger, such as the use of organic ingredients or healthier cooking methods,
play a more significant role in their decision-making process.

Lastly, factor_6, the least important factor, goes to “availability of discounts” rows with
48.4%. This implies that factors related to factor_6, such as the availability of discounts,
promotional offers, or loyalty programs, have the least impact on respondents' decision
when choosing where to get a burger.

### CORRELATION ANALYSIS BETWEEN AGE, GENDER AND FREQUENCY

### BURGERS EAT PER MONTH.

Crosstabulation between the variable “burgerspermonth” and “agegroup” provides
information on the frequency of burger consumption in different age groups. The table
shows the number and percentage distribution within each age group. Of those aged 18-20,
no one reported consuming burgers rarely (1-3 times) per month. However, one person
(100% within the age group) reported consuming burgers occasionally (4-6 times) per
month. In the 21-25 age group, 19 individuals (67.9% within the age group) reported rarely
eating burgers, while 9 individuals (32.1% within the age group) reported occasionally


eating burgers. In the 26-to 30-year- old age group, one person (50.0% in the age group)
reported rarely eating burgers, and one person (50.0% in the age group) reported
occasionally eating burgers. Overall, of the total sample of 31, one person (3.2% of the
total) reported eating burgers occasionally, and 20 people (64.5% of the total) reported
eating burgers infrequently. It is important to note that the percentages within each age
group add up to 100%, indicating the distribution of frequency of burger consumption
within each age group. These results indicate that most individuals in the sample, regardless
of age group, reported consuming burgers infrequently, with a higher prevalence in the
younger age groups (18-20 years and 21-25 years).

The chi-square tests were conducted to examine the association between the variables
“burgerspermonth” and “agegroup”. The table contains the test statistics, degrees of
freedom (df) and the asymptotic significance values for each test. The Pearson Chi-Square
test yielded a value of 2.139 with 2 degrees of freedom, resulting in an asymptotic
significance value of 0.343. The likelihood ratio test yielded a value of 2.387 with 2 degrees
of freedom, leading to an asymptotic significance value of 0 .303. Finally, the linear-by-
linear association test yielded a value of 0 .179 with 1 degree of freedom, leading to an
asymptotic significance value of 0 .672. Based on the significance values, none of the chi-
square tests produced a statistically significant result at the usual significance level (α =
0 .05). The significance value (p-value) for the Pearson Chi-Square is greater than 0.05,
indicating that the associations observed between the variables “burgerspermonth” and
“agegroup” are not statistically significant at the 0.05 level. This indicates that there is not
enough evidence to conclude a significant relationship between the variables
“burgerspermonth” and “agegroup”.


To analyze the relationship between “burgerspermonth” and “gender”, we can refer to the
crosstabulation table. The table displays the frequency and percentage distribution of
burger consumption categories ("Rarely" and "Occasionally") based on gender. In the
“Rarely (1-3 times)” category, there were a total of 20 respondents. Among them, 10 were
female, representing 76.9% of the female respondents, and 10 were male, representing
55.6% of the male respondents. In the “Occasionally (4-6 times)” category, there were a
total of 11 respondents. Among them, 3 were female, accounting for 23.1% of the female
respondents, and 8 were male, accounting for 44.4% of the male respondents. Examining
the overall distribution, out of the total 31 respondents, the “Rarely” category accounted
for 64.5% of the total respondents. The “Occasionally” category constituted 35.5% of the
total respondents.

A chi-square test can be used to determine the statistical significance of the association
between “burgerspermonth” and “gender”. The chi-square test determines whether a
significant association exists between categorical variables. The test findings provide a p-


value, which reflects the likelihood of the observed data assuming no association between
the variables. The table includes statistical information such as the test statistic, degrees of
freedom (df), and asymptotic significance level. The Pearson Chi-Square test statistic is
1.505 with 1 degree of freedom. The p-value for asymptotic significance is 0.220. The
likelihood ratio test, on the other hand, yields a test statistic of 1.548 and a p-value of 0.213.
The p-values show the likelihood of seeing the data or more severe outcomes if there was
no correlation between the variables. The p-values in this instance (0.220 and 0.213) are
higher than the usual 0.05 level of significance. Based on the data given, we could make
the conclusion that the chi-square tests did not provide any statistically significant evidence
that “burgerspermonth” and “gender” are correlated.

### KENDALL’S W TEST FOR FACTORS’ RANK

The ranking of the factors, based on their importance in determining burger preferences,
was determined by Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance Test. The mean ranks for the
factors were as follows: factor_1 (2.32), factor_2 (2.52), factor_3 (3.55), factor_4 (3.52),
factor_5 (4.42) and factor_6 (4.68). These rankings indicate the observed importance of
each factor, with a lower mean indicating higher importance.

Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance (Kendall's W) measures the degree of agreement
between the rankings. The calculated value of Kendall's W test is 0.262. This indicates
moderate agreement between the rankings, which means that there is some agreement on
the relative importance of the factors.


To assess the statistical significance of the observed agreement, a Chi-Square test was
performed. The Chi-Square test statistic was calculated as 40.641, with 5 degrees of
freedom. The associated p-value was determined to be 0.000, which is below the statistical
significance level of 0.05. This indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis and
suggests that the observed agreement among the rankings is statistically significant.

The results of the analysis indicate that there is significant agreement between respondents
on the importance of the factors in determining burger preferences. The probability of such
an agreement being due to chance alone is very low. Therefore, we can have confidence in
the reliability and validity of the rankings.

The rankings provide valuable insights for decision-making processes. Factor_1 turns out
to be the most important factor, followed by factor_2, factor_3, factor_4, factor_5, and
finally factor_6. These results suggest that factors related to taste, price, nutrition, waiting
time, distance from the location and availability of discounts/coupons respectively, play a
different role in influencing burger preferences.


### CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the analysis of the data provided has produced insightful conclusions
regarding the factors that influence burger preferences among the surveyed individuals.
The findings shed light on various aspects, including age group, gender, faculty
relationship, and the ranking of factors influencing burger preferences. These insights can
be valuable for businesses and marketers in the burger industry, helping them understand
consumer behavior and make informed decisions to cater to their target audience
effectively.

The analysis revealed that age group plays a role in burger consumption patterns, with the
21 - 25 years old age group reporting the highest frequency of burger consumption. Gender
also showed some differences, with females having a higher percentage of respondents
consuming burgers rarely, while males had a higher percentage of occasional consumers.
These findings suggest that age and gender can influence burger consumption habits to
some extent.

The crosstabulation between burger place preference and faculty affiliation indicated
variations in preferences among different faculties. Fast-food chains were the preferred
choice among the Business and Economics, Engineering, and Medicine faculties. On the
other hand, hawker stalls were popular among the Arts and Social Sciences, Science, and
FSKTM faculties. These findings indicate that faculty relationships may play a role in
shaping the choice of burger place.

The analysis ranked the factors influencing burger preferences based on their importance.
Taste emerged as the most crucial factor, followed by price, nutrition, waiting time,
distance from location, and availability of discounts/coupons. This suggests that the
sensory experience of taste holds significant importance in determining burger preferences.
Businesses in the burger industry can prioritize enhancing the taste of their offerings to
attract and retain customers.

The statistical significance of the observed relationships was assessed through Chi-Square
tests and Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance test. While no significant associations were
found between age group, gender, and faculty affiliation, the Kendall's Coefficient of


Concordance test revealed a moderate level of agreement among the ranks of factors. The
associated chi-square test confirmed the statistical significance of this agreement.

Finally, this analysis provides valuable insights for businesses and sellers operating in the
burger industry. By understanding the factors that influence consumer preferences,
businesses can develop targeted marketing strategies, improve product offerings, and
enhance customer satisfaction. Emphasizing taste, addressing price concerns, and
considering factors like nutrition, waiting time, distance from location, and availability of
discounts/coupons can help businesses tailor their offerings to meet consumer demands
effectively.
